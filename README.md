# Human AI JavaScript Class

## Version
0.0.1

## Overview
The `HumanCore` class simulates human moods and emotions, providing methods to manage health, moods, and feelings. This class is a basic framework for creating an AI representation of a human with emotional attributes, including methods for setting and listing moods and feelings. The `Human` class acts as a wrapper to interact with `HumanCore`, while the `DevTools` class provides a way to access both core functionalities and the human instance.

## Features
- Manage health status (0 to 100%).
- Set and retrieve moods and feelings.
- List all existing moods and feelings.
- Encapsulation of the `HumanCore` within the `Human` class for easy access.

## Installation

To use this class, ensure you have Node.js installed. You can clone this repository or copy the code into your own JavaScript file.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
